Convert Detect-It-Easy to Yara rules

This was initiated by Fernando MercÃªs. The idea is to convert [Detect It Easy](https://github.com/horsicq/Detect-It-Easy) scripts to Yara rules, so that threat researchers can hunt with automatically updated rulesets.

It is still in early stage. Pull requests are welcome.
